The OSC library is an implementation of Open Sound Control. Open Sound Control (OSC) 
is a protocol for communication between computers, sound synthesizers, and other multimedia 
devices. Using modern networking technology OSC's advantages include interoperability, 
accuracy, flexibility, and enhanced organization 
and documentation.
</p>
<p>
This simple yet powerful protocol provides everything needed for real-time control 
of sound and other media processing while remaining flexible and easy to implement.

Features:
<ul>
    <li>Open-ended, dynamic, URL-style symbolic naming scheme</li>
    <li>Symbolic and high-resolution numeric argument data</li>
    <li>Pattern matching language to specify multiple recipients of a single message</li>
    <li>High resolution time tags</li>
    <li>"Bundles" of messages whose effects must occur simultaneously</li>
    <li>Query system to dynamically find out the capabilities of an OSC server and get documentation</li>
    </ul>

OSC Research at CNMAT
OSC was originally developed, and continues to be a subject of ongoing research at UC Berkeley Center for New Music and Audio Technology (CNMAT). 
CNMAT is an interdisciplinary research center within the UC Berkeley Department of Music. 
CNMAT is known for its dynamic educational, performance and research programs focusing on 
the creative interaction between music and technology. The Center's goal is to provide a 
common ground where music, cognitive science, computer science, and other disciplines meet 
to investigate, invent and implement creative tools for composers and performers. For more
